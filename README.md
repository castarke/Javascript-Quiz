# Javascript-Quiz

## Description

In this repo you will find a 10 question quiz about Javascript. This Quiz was created using Javascript functions to start the quiz timer when the start button is clicked. The start button is hidden once the quiz is started and at the end of the quiz you are able to enter you name and submit it for the highscore. There is also a highscore page where you view previous highscores. Highscores are saved on locoal storage and pulled onto the highscore page. Throughout making this quiz I was able to gain better understanding of how to use functions within Javascript.
